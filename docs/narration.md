## The Story Begins

You arrive at an old shed—an inheritance from your grandfather. As you explore the dusty, forgotten space, you find something peculiar: a simple hand crank mechanism. When you give it a turn, you hear a faint humming sound. It works. This marks the beginning of your journey into building a vast computational network.

# Core: The Old Shed (🏠)

**Location:** Grandpa's abandoned shed  
**The Setup:** You just inherited this old shed from your grandfather. It looks abandoned, but maybe there's something useful inside?

This is where it all begins. The shed serves as your base of operations—a place where old technology meets possibility.

# Branch 1: Energy Generation (🔧)

> *"Without energy, nothing can function. Every great invention needs a power source."*

The energy branch focuses on harnessing various power sources to drive your network. Each upgrade increases your capacity to generate and manage energy more efficiently.

## Tier 1: The Hand Crank

**Hand Crank (🔧)** - You find a simple hand crank. Why not give it a turn, whats the worst that could happen?
- *Narration:* "When you turn the crank, you hear a faint humming sound..."
- **Effect:** +1 Energy per click
- **Role:** The foundation of your energy generation. Manual, but reliable.

## Tier 2: Optimizations & Alternatives

This tier focuses on improving your energy output through mechanical optimization and discovering alternative sources.

**Lubricant (🧴)** - The crank is a bit stiff, maybe some oil would help it turn more smoothly?
- **Requirement:** Hand Crank
- **Cost:** 5 Energy
- **Effect:** +1 Energy per click (smoother operation)
- **Role:** Mechanical optimization. Sometimes small improvements compound.

**Hamster Wheel (🐹)** - My hamster loves running in this thing, and it generates energy too!
- **Requirement:** Hand Crank
- **Cost:** 5 Energy
- **Effect:** +0.5 Energy/second (passive automation)
- **Role:** Your first automated system. Set it and forget it.

**Lightbulb (💡)** - Let there be light!
- **Requirements:** Both Lubricant AND Hamster Wheel
- **Cost:** 25 Energy
- **Effect:** Illuminates the shed, revealing new possibilities
- *Narration:* "When you turn on the light, the room is illuminated. The shed is empty, but there's an attic hatch above you that wasn't visible before."
- **Role:** A crucial milestone. Visibility leads to discovery.

## Tier 2+: The Discovery

**Explore Attic (📦)** - Since we have light now, why not search grandpa's attic for cool stuff?
- **Requirement:** Lightbulb
- **Cost:** 5 Energy
- **Effect:** Unlocks the Computer branch
- *Narration:* "You found an old computer up in the attic! Lets see if it still works..."
- **Role:** The gateway to the next phase of your journey.

# Branch 2: Computing (💻)

> *"Energy is power, but data is knowledge. Knowledge is everything."*

Your grandfather's old computer awaits. This branch transforms raw energy into computational power, allowing you to process and manage information at scale.

## Tier 1: Boot Up

**Grandpa's Old PC (💻)** - An old computer left behind by your grandfather. Let's boot it up and see what it can do!
- **Requirement:** Explore Attic
- **Cost:** 15 Energy
- **Role:** The foundation of your computational network. Old hardware, but it has potential.

## Design Philosophy: Progression & Story

Each branch represents a technological focus area. As you progress:

1. **Early tiers** establish basic capabilities and introduce key mechanics
2. **Mid tiers** introduce optimization, passive systems, and resource management
3. **Late tiers** unlock new branches and exponentially expand your reach

The network grows through discovery and optimization. What seemed impossible at the start becomes routine with the right investments. Every unlock tells a part of your grandfather's legacy—tools he left behind, systems waiting to be rediscovered, a path from manual labor to automated computational power.
