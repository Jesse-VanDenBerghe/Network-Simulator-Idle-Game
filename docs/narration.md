# Document description

This document outlines the narration of the game's branch progression plan, detailing how players will unlock and progress through various technology branches in the skill tree.

# Outlines

The user begins their journey with nothing but an old shed inherited from their grandfather. While exploring the shed, they discover basic tools and a crank generator. This marks the beginning of their adventure into building a vast network.

# Branch Progression

Each branch represents a different technological focus area, and players will unlock these branches as they reach specific milestones in the game.

## Core (🏠)
**Old Shed** - You just inherited this old shed from your grandfather. It looks abandoned, but maybe there's something useful inside?

## Branch 1: Energy (⚡)
The user discovers an old hand crank in the shed. Turning it generates energy. Without energy, nothing can function. Progressing through this branch will allow the user to generate and manage energy more efficiently.

### Tier 1:
- **Hand Crank** - You find a simple hand crank. Why not give it a turn, what's the worst that could happen?

### Tier 2:
- **Oil** - The crank is a bit stiff, maybe some oil would help it turn more smoothly?
- **Hamster Wheel** - My hamster loves running in this thing, and it generates energy too! (+0.5 Energy/second passive)
- **Lightbulb** - Let there be light! Can't see in the dark? No problem, this lightbulb will help you out.

### Tier 3:
- **Explore Attic** - Since we have light now, why not search grandpa's attic for cool stuff? (Unlocks Computer branch)

## Branch 2: Computer (�)
The user discovers grandpa's old PC in the attic. This branch focuses on turning energy into raw data.

### Tier 1:
- **Grandpa's old PC** - An old computer left behind by your grandfather. Let's boot it up and see what it can do!
